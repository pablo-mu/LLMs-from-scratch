    "Pre-LLMs architectures had some problems. For instance, a model that translates text word by word in a fixed order could lead to grammatical errors. Normally is used an *encoder* and *decoder* to adress this problem, where the job of the encoder is to read in and process the text, and the decoder then produces the translated text. Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were the most popular encoder–decoder architecture for language translation. An RNN is a type of neural network where outputs from previous steps are fed as inputs to the current step. \n",
